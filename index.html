      'There is no literature without a Café – stated Sándor Márai, a Hungarian
      writer from the 20th century, who himself frequently visited the
      historical building of the Royal Brew Café. The Royal Brew Caféhas lived
      through many eras, political systems and historical turning points. Still,
      it has always been reborn, sparkling and occupied by those who longed for
      its comforts: artists, members of the nobility and commoners alike.

<h3>Dear Guests,</h3>
<p>Due to the increasing demand of the Royal Brew Café, table reservation is only available for dinners after 6 pm.

    During 8 am – 6 pm  the seating is in order upon arrival. Of course our colleges will try to do their best to seat the arrivals as soon as possible
    
    For dinner reservation please fill out the form below and we will confirm your reservation within 24 hours. In case the system is closed already for the given period of time, we still encourage you to come and visit us because we always keep some tables available for guests arriving without a reservation after 6 pm.
    
    Thank you for your understanding!</p>
    <h3>Opening Hours:</h3>
    <p>Monday to Sunday: 08:00 - 24:00</p>
    <h5>To the Café, we can only accept table reservations of up to 10 people. In every other case, please contact one of our event organizer colleagues</h5>
